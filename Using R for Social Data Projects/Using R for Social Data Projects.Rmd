Today, we want to write about "social data challenges". Participants partake in a series of prompts designed for a variety of skill sets and levels. These challenges are an opportunity to practice programming skills, work on algorithmic efficiency, or learn something new. Often, participants share the code for their submissions, teaching others their processes and techniques.

The challenges test the participants' tenacity with time-bound but flexible prompts. For example, the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) invites participants to create a new map every day in November. The themes are broad: points, land, heatmap. Participants are able to interpret them how they choose.

Although these projects are often language-agnostic, R users often take part. In January, [genuary](http://genuary.art/) encourages participants to create works of generative art based on a series of prompts. R users creatively apply their coding skills to create stunning works of design. On Day 6 of genuary, [Ryan Timpe](https://twitter.com/ryantimpe) "destroys the square":

[Taking a look at the code](https://github.com/ryantimpe/genuary2022/blob/main/R/gen_05.R), we can see applications of R that go beyond statistics and data science. We learn how to plot a square in R:

```
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(12238)

#The square

square_size = 400

the_square <- expand_grid(
  x=1:square_size,
  y=1:square_size
) %>%
  mutate(
    color = "#87ceeb"
  )

plot(the_square$x, the_square$y)
```

We can also see how Ryan inserts randomness in the plot through strategic use of functions like `sample()` and `runif()`:

```
circ_origin_size = square_size * runif(1, 2/4, 3/4) 
```

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is another example of a social data challenge. Borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, RStudio’s own [Tom Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) shares a dataset for participants every Tuesday. TidyTuesday encourages R users to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem (although, participants are free to use whatever package they’d like).

[Moriah Taylor](https://twitter.com/moriah_taylor58) visualizes alternative fueling stations in the U.S. using the [layer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/layer/index.html) package. The use of stacked tilted maps communicates relationships, density, and location while being visually beautiful.

Interested in participating in a social data challenge? The [30 Day Chart Challenge](https://twitter.com/30DayChartChall) is coming up in April. Everyday, the challenge offers a new chart type for you to visualize. Showcase your R skills, test your perseverance, and use the hashtag `#30DayChartChallenge` to share your work with other participants.

We have started to compile a list of social data challenges. Please add a comment if you are aware of others.
